# Airlines Delay and Cancellation project

# Introduction 

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.

**Exploratory** data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

**Explanatory** data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

# Overview
Dataset Description:
This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays. The goal of this project is to summarize the data by time periods, carriers,airports and understand different factors causing the airline delays and cancellation.

# Summary of Findings ðŸ“”
- American Eagel Airlines and American Airlines were the most cancelled flights.
- The most cancelletion flights were because of the Weather and Carrier.
- Cancelled and Delayed Flights more happened in February, December, January and March, and more happened during the day of week.
- Arrival Delay with Departure Delay were highly correlated 93%.
- Distance with Actual Elapsed Time and Air Time were highly correlated (96% - 98%).
- The short Distance for both cancelled and delayed flights were more likely to happened more than the long distance.
- Northwest Airlines has the most delayed flights followed by American Eagel Airlines and American Airlines.

suggestions If you want to book a flight form the above analysis I can say :
